Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side."], 'input_ids': [[17785, 461, 368, 3390, 17953, 525, 1809, 28950, 861, 4731, 82469, 3370, 404, 75671, 63966, 30845, 722, 1877, 51478, 17, 12941, 1306, 4548, 15, 661, 1119, 632, 24308, 3595, 36643, 1002, 1074, 17, 27069, 154878, 10398, 2175, 3968, 11736, 861, 98581, 1074, 3638, 75671, 1620, 3776, 36213, 25207, 530, 447, 3326, 107029, 386, 125347, 461, 21415, 15, 2131, 1907, 361, 4548, 1485, 368, 14679, 55536, 17, 86036, 1074, 15, 1119, 632, 1130, 267, 6460, 613, 368, 142593, 23724, 376, 791, 5884, 356, 17, 3904, 6460, 141478, 654, 5755, 7231, 1002, 62262, 427, 51667, 15, 7025, 791, 21415, 17, 41969, 632, 12587, 15214, 15, 361, 368, 95460, 2971, 461, 368, 14679, 17, 27069, 154878, 10398, 3548, 632, 9487, 770, 61, 661, 861, 632, 368, 75221, 3312, 8885, 427, 368, 7890, 87547, 177212, 30333, 14688, 9660, 61993, 1912, 17, 3162, 133680, 44363, 664, 145082, 3733, 14585, 15, 660, 45173, 13773, 461, 368, 22691, 4618, 1728, 368, 13953, 1542, 43810, 178683, 530, 10844, 361, 12548, 15, 1427, 115777, 632, 1130, 6426, 664, 368, 25169, 17, 5749, 14585, 632, 10863, 427, 7112, 566, 3375, 92, 703, 15, 131914, 15, 46300, 553, 296, 15, 10358, 9209, 15, 144288, 15, 65965, 703, 15, 67026, 530, 3172, 3250, 1515, 3359, 7145, 1336, 15, 14905, 960, 7708, 15, 140032, 34801, 17691, 3164, 530, 1804, 21239, 72666, 1306, 11705, 8372, 14723, 17, 27069, 154878, 10398, 44, 3276, 5894, 368, 4291, 57709, 461, 368, 6460, 632, 11594, 427, 368, 5919, 861, 718, 22108, 4618, 3390, 17082, 44657, 142502, 17, 5070, 1587, 26489, 65713, 148724, 613, 125432, 199617, 15, 50827, 85753, 15, 50827, 73190, 1369, 50, 61, 11326, 17968, 10515, 17, 1387, 3968, 63966, 473, 19082, 25338, 98581, 1074, 661, 1427, 294, 74182, 718, 1620, 174123, 15, 473, 45240, 5894, 473, 1620, 29659, 613, 718, 15, 1965, 661, 473, 135986, 3172, 15, 473, 24740, 267, 79761, 613, 75671, 15, 530, 8610, 2995, 7432, 376, 427, 368, 6426, 22064, 461, 148157, 21415, 17, 10366, 3370, 21415, 15, 1965, 204372, 375, 82473, 51478, 141771, 5268, 8722, 722, 16993, 1800, 613, 267, 157045, 15, 216398, 5268, 8722, 22552, 664, 7092, 530, 2213, 14723, 1002, 718, 15, 6355, 33365, 376, 15, 28834, 2591, 216398, 6610, 38796, 3727, 22691, 9705, 7231, 11594, 427, 3808, 31345, 461, 40634, 57626, 791, 22691, 24575, 12, 58613, 386, 75671, 15, 1152, 2742, 17158, 103399, 1002, 3595, 632, 24
